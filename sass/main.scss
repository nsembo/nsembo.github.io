Sass 7-1 architecture/pattern by Hugo Giraudel for code organization
- basically 7 folders and 1 main file called main.scss
    - 7 folders are:
        - base/: resets, typographies, et al
        - components/: buttons, carousels, et al
        - layout/: header, footer, nav, sidebar, et al. Holds all our components together
        - pages/: for multi-pages web apps, the different pages, like home.scss, live here
        - themes/: theme.scss, admin.scss, et al
        - abstracts/: for CSS rules that don't output anything e.gvariables.scss, mixins.scss, functions.scss, et al
        - vendors/: contains external libraries and frameworks e.g bootstrap.scss, normalize.scss
    - main.scss: contains nothing other than imported partials, which contains code snippets.
